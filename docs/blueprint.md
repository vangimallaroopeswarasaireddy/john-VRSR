## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light cyan (#E0FFFF), a very pale tint of the primary, for a calm, bright feel.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF), a brighter analogous hue, to draw attention to interactive elements.

- Use modern, minimalist icons to represent tasks, portfolio items, and tutoring topics.
